<h1>Luke Clicker R6 "The Final Frontier"</h1>
<p style="font-family: Comic Sans MS:> Guess why this update is called "The Final Fronteir"? Because its the last major update for Luke Clicker. "Why??" you may ask. Because this game was made to see what I am capable
 of when it comes to game-making. And currently, its not much, so this is the end of Luke Clicker (for now). I might make more games soon, and I will still post to these blogs. Peace.

 <h1>Compatibility</h1>
 <p style="font-family: Comic Sans MS"> Luke Clicker R5 has just been tested on my Dell Latitude D630 running Windows 7. It ran perfectly fine. Here are the specs: Intel Core 2 Duo @ 2.00 GHz, Intel GM965 Chipset (On board graphics), 3 GB DDR2.
  I also should mention that it was run at 1080p (Connected to my monitor through VGA).
